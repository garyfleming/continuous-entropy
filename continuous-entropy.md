# Fighting Continuous Entropy
## Adventures in Continuous Delivery

^ My name is... I am a...
^ The talk is called Fighting Continuous Entropy. When I have a talk called something like that, I have to accept that some of the audience, maybe most of you, don't know what entropy is. So let's start with something not technical (in the software sense)

# What is Entropy?

> "Disorder of a system"

^ I'll try to explain but, if you're a physicist, you'll probably disagree. That's fine. I'm simplifying for the benefit of everyone else, which means I'm going to be a bit wrong.

# What is Entropy?

> "Disorder of a system"

^ Does that help? More disorder means more possible states of a system.
Entropy of the universe ONLY increases. Same of any closed system.

# Systems

^ Where parts come together to do something that the individual parts couldn't
^ TODO this is a crappy definition of a system. Tighten it up.

# System Experiment: Fishes

^ Imagine a polystyrene box. Place in it a piece of fish. Pack it up with ice. What happens?
^ It depends.

# System Experiment: Fishes and Time

* 10 minutes?
* 10 hours?
* 10 days?
* 10000 years?

^ time is a key component of understanding entropy in systems. We might know (to some degree) the state of a system at some point, but over time it will change. Consider our fish box at these time scales. 10 minutes? Probably much the same. 10 hours? Ice will be melting but fish might be fine. 10 days? Fish will be rotten. 10000 years? The box will have started to breakdown.

# Software and Entropy

^ TODO rename slide?
^ So why have I been talking about entropy at all?
^ You might think that you write your software and put it into production and it'll remain the same forever. That's sadly not true. Code rots. It's a fish in a box, and the ice is melting.
^ What can we do to mitigate against the entropy?
