# Continuous Entropy

Our software lives in an entropic state. The world changes around it: new bugs appear, new versions, new operating systems, new hardware. Our systems must change or face eventual demise.

We often adopt approaches to continuously deploy our systems, but what if we had tools that let us continuously upgrade them too; pushing the entropy back a little bit each day.

We'll talk about CI/CD, and some advanced practices we can use to keep our systems continually fresh, continually rejuvenated.
