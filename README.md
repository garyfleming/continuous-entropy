# Fighting Continuous Entropy with Continuous Integration

Our software lives in an entropic state. The world changes around it: new bugs appear, new versions, new operating systems, new hardware; even our people change.. Our systems must change or face inevitable rot.

We often adopt approaches to continuously deploy our systems, but what if we had tools that let us continuously upgrade them too; pushing the entropy back a little bit each day.

Come along and learn about some advanced Continuos Integration/Delivery practices we can use to keep our systems continually fresh, continually rejuvenated. Let's use automation to explore how we keep our systems from rotting away, without pain.

## Alternate history

### Fight Code and Team Rot Using Continuous Improvement

What happens when you leave a codebase alone for a year? Would you expect it to still work? What about 5 years? 10 years?

If you've experienced you know the answer: it's a whole bunch of work to replatform the code to something more modern, more supported.

It doesn't have to be like this.

What if we used continuous integration and deployment techniques to ensure an easier future for ourselves and our future teams? Let's discuss a world in which we can write systems that, to a large degree, can look after themselves when we're not looking.

### Learning Outcomes

1. You'll learn more about continuous integration and continuous deployment if you aren't already doing them,
2. You'll explore the reasons behind code rot and be given tools to help avoid those problems,
3. You'll get to see that there are similar problems at other levels of development that we also need to focus on

## Organisational versions

### Constraint planning: using governing and enabling constraints to build orgs

"It's Re-organisation time"; something many of us have heard too often, but how often does it help?

We know that, over time, our organisations will begin to take the wrong shape for their current contexts, but we rarely plan for that. Instead of reacting, what if we designed our organisations with change in mind?

By designing governing and enabling constraints for our organisations, we can find better ways to shape them. By adding observations, we can find the right time to try something new. Join us for a conversation on how organisational design could be improved.

### Guidelines

This version would focus on other areas of entropy. Rather than tech, how about structure and governance? How would you build an org such that the rules for changing it are built in?

We'd talk about enabling and governing constraints at an org level, but also measures for sensing when the constraints are failing
